# Incremental Static Regeneration with Next.js Combines Performance with Accuracy

One of the biggest concerns in modern web development is performance optimization. Itâ€™s been well-documented that carving every possible millisecond off page-load times [improves the user experience](https://wpostats.com), which can result in deeper engagement and higher conversion rates. 

Today, we rely on server and browser caching along with content delivery networks (CDNs) to streamline and localize network requests to provide the fastest page loads possible. But for sites that change frequently, how can we ensure that users are also getting the most current content, without fetching new data for every browser request or manually rebuilding the site for each content change? 

During a recent Next.js application build, I explored this challenge and found that [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/incremental-static-regeneration) lets us walk the line, providing best-in-class performance while also ensuring up-to-the-minute content.
